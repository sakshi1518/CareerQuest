        <h2>NDSE (National Talent Search Exam)</h2>
        <h3>Eligible Students: 10th class | Syllabus: Science, Maths , Social , Mental ablility </h3>
        <p>NTSE or National Talent Search Examination is a national level exam conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for granting scholarships to meritorious students studying in class 10th. NTSE is only held
          for 10th standard students and the exam is conducted in two different stages – Stage I and II.

          The first stage exam is a state-level exam and is conducted by all the Indian states and UTs. On the other hand, NTSE stage II is conducted for those students who clear the first stage. As mentioned earlier, only those who qualify in NTSE
          stage 1 will be eligible to write the Stage II exam. This is the main criteria. Meanwhile, the objective of organizing NTSE is to award scholarships to potential candidates who are aspiring to pursue higher education in the field of Science
          or Social Studies. With these scholarships, students will be able to continue their education in their desired stream. NTSE scholarship will be awarded on the basis of the overall performance of students in both stages of the examination.

        <h2>(NSTSE)National Level Science Talent Search Examination</h2>
        <h3>Eligible Students: 1 to 12th class | Syllabus: CBSE/ICSE Syllabus</h3>
        <p>NSTSE is a diagnostic test which helps students improve their overall learning ability and educational performance.
          <BR>
          Unlike other tests which may only find out how much a student knows or has memorised, NSTSE measures how well a student has understood the concepts and provides a detailed feedback on the same, to help him/her improve.
          <br>
          Thus NSTSE helps each student to know early, whether he/she has properly understood a concept, so that immediate action can be taken to correct the aberration and pave a path for improvement. Often, students develop conceptual gaps which
          increase as the students go to higher classes and turn those into a ‘phobia’ for the subject.
          <br>
          School tests - including board exams - tend to test children superficially, only to the extent what they have memorised. But the important skills like the ability to think independently and reason logically – most critical in today's world
          - are often not aimed at or tested in school tests.
          <br>
          The focus on fundamentals is very important as when the child finishes studies he/she will have to face the competitive world armed with those fundamentals. Even while opting for higher studies, a student has to go through a complete scan
          of what he/she knows and how much. Exams like IIT-JEE, AIEEE, AFMC, AIIMS, GRE, GMAT, CAT etc., are designed to test the fundamental strength of a student. Hence the need of the hour is to build the fundamental-base as strong and as early
          as possible. This exactly is the philosophy behind Unified Council's NSTSE.

        <h2>MTSE (Maths Talent Search Exam)</h2>
        <h3>Eligible Students: 3 to 9th class | Syllabus:Mental ability,
          Reasoning, Maths</h3>
        <p>Maths Talent Search Examination (MTSE) is a competitive examination conducted at various levels by the Indian Institute for Studies in Mathematics (IISMA). The focus of this exam is on mathematical reasoning, mental ability, novel
          approach, concepts, accuracy and speed.
          <br>
          MTSE is an open exam. Any student studying in Class III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX under any educational board is eligible to appear for MTSE. A student can appear only for the class in which he/she is studying during the academic year.
          <br>
          The paper consists of 35 objective questions i.e. each question has 4 alternatives. These questions are to be answered in 60 minutes on an A-I based Online Test platform from home with a webcam enabled device.

          The system will not allow a student to log in unless and until the webcam is enabled. The system will continuously catch, record and process the facial movements, eyes movements, lips movements, objects movements, whispering of sound, etc.
          and flag the irregularities through data forensics. During an exam, if the webcam is disabled, then the system may debar the student from writing the exam further.

          Each correct answer will be awarded with 2 marks. There will not be any NEGATIVE marking for wrong answers.

        <h2>IMO (International Mathematics
          Olympiad)</h2>
        <h3>Eligible Students: 1 to 12th class | Syllabus:CBSE/ICSE Syllabus</h3>
        <p>The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is a mathematical olympiad for pre-university students, and is the oldest of the International Science Olympiads.[1] It is one of the most prestigious mathematical competitions in the world.
          The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. It has since been held annually, except in 1980. More than 100 countries participate. Each country sends a team of up to six students,[2] plus one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.[3]
          <br>
          The content ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems in branches of mathematics not conventionally covered in secondary or high school and often not at university level either, such as projective and
          complex geometry, functional equations, combinatorics, and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, as there is a principle that anyone with
          a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant,
          deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity, often times a great deal of ingenuity to net all points for a given IMO problem.

          from both teachers and students since its inception.

          The iOS examination, which takes place annually, aims to test students' competency in science and is based on the syllabus provided by CBSE/ICSE and other State Boards. However, the examination paper also includes a section on Applied
          Science, which enables students to develop a deeper understanding of how science is applied in the real world.

          By aligning with the ICSE, CBSE, and State board syllabuses, the international olympiad of Science provides a solid foundation for school children to thrive in Science. The competition helps students develop a strong knowledge base,
          critical thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities that will serve them well in their future academic and professional endeavors.

          One of the most significant benefits of participating in the International Olympiad of Science is the detailed report students receive after the examination. The report offers students an opportunity to delve deeper into their strengths and
          weaknesses, identify areas for improvement, and motivate them to strive for excellence in their studies. Overall, the International Olympiad of Science plays a vital role in encouraging young students to pursue their passion for science and
