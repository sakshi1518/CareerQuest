    <P>You must’ve heard the famous quote by Edward Teller, “The Science of Today is the Technology of Tomorrow.” It simply explains how innovative discoveries in the present lead to a better life in the future.
<br>

        Choosing a Science stream provides students amazing research opportunities and brings them closer to innovative technologies. Candidates get to study subjects like Physics and Chemistry to gain an in-depth understanding of the universe's physical, chemical, and biological aspects. Plus, it also helps with their problem-solving and analytical abilities. 
       <br> 
        
        The Science stream consists of scientific theories and practical concepts that help polish their knowledge regarding natural and artificial processes in the world. As a result, students qualified in the science stream have a wide range of career opportunities, including Space research, Computer Science, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Pharmaceuticals,  Forensic Science, Mechanical Engineering, etc.</P>

            <h2>PCM</h2>
            <P>PCM stands for Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, which are three core subjects taught in science education. In many educational systems, PCM is a common abbreviation used to refer to the combination of these three subjects as a specific course of study or a stream. Physics: Physics is the branch of science that deals with the fundamental principles of the universe, including the study of matter, energy, motion, and the interactions between particles and forces. It involves understanding concepts such as mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, and quantum mechanics. Chemistry: Chemistry is the science that explores the properties, composition, structure, and reactions of matter. It is concerned with understanding the behavior of elements, compounds, and molecules, as well as various chemical reactions and processes. Mathematics: Mathematics is the study of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. It provides the language and tools to analyze and solve problems in various scientific disciplines, including physics and chemistry. In PCM, mathematics is essential for handling complex calculations and mathematical models in both subjects. PCM is a popular stream of study among students who aspire to pursue careers in engineering, technology, architecture, computer science, and various other fields of science. Students who opt for PCM in their higher secondary education (grades 11 and 12) typically have opportunities to pursue engineering or science-related degrees in college.</P>
